This was my first dashboard creation in Microsoft PowerBI. I wanted to learn how to clean and transform data and then utilize PowerBI to create aesthetic visualizations of the data! 

The dataset I utilized was: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data 
It provided information on Team wins/losses between the yeard 1966-2021. 
The dashboard below shows 3 bar graphs. The bar graphs display the total wins by team, the top 5 teams, and the bottom 5 teams. Along with the number of total teams, seasons, and games over the 60 years.
