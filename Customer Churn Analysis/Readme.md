# Customer Churn Analysis
## Discovery
### What's the problem?
The company needs to figure out which customers are churned based on age, credit score, and account balance. The target churn rate they are aiming for is 11%. I added more insights to display data on customers based on age, gender, credit card status, active member status, and the country which the customer is based in. 
## Insights
### Exploring & Analyzing the data
The data contains 12 columns with 10,000+ records. After removing null values and columns which don't pertain relevant informatin regarding churn rate, I moved on to create groups for age, credit score, and account balance. This creation of groups allows the data to be displayed in a more digestable manner. Then, I created references to the groups to establish indexes so that each group can be displayed from least to greatest.

The client can display contents based on churned/not churned customers and see how the churn rate compares to the target churn rate determined by the requirements. The area graphs toward the bottom accomplish the needs of the client to determine customers churned based on age groups, credit score groups, and account balance groups.
